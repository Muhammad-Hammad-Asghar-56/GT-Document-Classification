The six classic simple machines known ancient Near East. The wedge inclined plane (ramp) known since prehistoric times.[9] The wheel, along wheel axle mechanism, invented Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) 5th millennium BC.[10] The lever mechanism first appeared around 5,000 years ago Near East, used simple balance scale,[11] move large objects ancient Egyptian technology.[12] The lever also used shadoof water-lifting device, first crane machine, appeared Mesopotamia c. 3000 BC,[11] ancient Egyptian technology c. 2000 BC.[13] The earliest evidence pulleys date back Mesopotamia early 2nd millennium BC,[14] ancient Egypt Twelfth Dynasty (1991–1802 BC).[15] The screw, last simple machines invented,[16] first appeared Mesopotamia Neo-Assyrian period (911–609) BC.[14] The Egyptian pyramids built using three six simple machines, inclined plane, wedge, lever, create structures like Great Pyramid Giza.[17] The earliest civil engineer known name Imhotep.[6] As one officials Pharaoh, Djosèr, probably designed supervised construction Pyramid Djoser (the Step Pyramid) Saqqara Egypt around 2630–2611 BC.[18] The earliest practical water-powered machines, water wheel watermill, first appeared Persian Empire, Iraq Iran, early 4th century BC.[19] Kush developed Sakia 4th century BC, relied animal power instead human energy.[20]Hafirs developed type reservoir Kush store contain water well boost irrigation.[21] Sappers employed build causeways military campaigns.[22] Kushite ancestors built speos Bronze Age 3700 3250 BC.[23]Bloomeries blast furnaces also created 7th centuries BC Kush.[24][25][26][27] Ancient Greece developed machines civilian military domains. The Antikythera mechanism, early known mechanical analog computer,[28][29] mechanical inventions Archimedes, examples Greek mechanical engineering. Some Archimedes' inventions, well Antikythera mechanism, required sophisticated knowledge differential gearing epicyclic gearing, two key principles machine theory helped design gear trains Industrial Revolution, widely used fields robotics automotive engineering.[30] Ancient Chinese, Greek, Roman Hunnic armies employed military machines inventions artillery developed Greeks around 4th century BC,[31] trireme, ballista catapult. In Middle Ages, trebuchet developed. Middle Ages The earliest practical wind-powered machines, windmill wind pump, first appeared Muslim world Islamic Golden Age, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, 9th century AD.[32][33][34][35] The earliest practical steam-powered machine steam jack driven steam turbine, described 1551 Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf Ottoman Egypt.[36][37] The cotton gin invented India 6th century AD,[38] spinning wheel invented Islamic world early 11th century,[39] fundamental growth cotton industry. The spinning wheel also precursor spinning jenny, key development early Industrial Revolution 18th century.[40] The earliest programmable machines developed Muslim world. A music sequencer, programmable musical instrument, earliest type programmable machine. The first music sequencer automated
