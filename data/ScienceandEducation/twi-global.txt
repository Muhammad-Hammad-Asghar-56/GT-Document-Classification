       Engineering is the application of science and maths to solve problems. While scientists and inventors come up with innovations, it is engineers who apply these discoveries to the real world.  Engineering is part of STEM education, which aims to engage students with science, technology, engineering and mathematics yet, as a discipline, it has been practiced for thousands of years. You can see examples of engineering in the Pyramids of Giza, at Stonehenge, the Parthenon and elsewhere. Yet, today’s engineers operate in many different areas as well as building structures. Engineers work on everything from cell membranes to construction and prosthetics to improving engine and transport efficiencies and developing renewable energy resources. While engineering dates right back to the invention of the wheel (and beyond), the term itself comes from the word engineer, which goes back to the 14th century, when an ‘engine’er’ meant someone who constructed military engines like catapults and other ‘siege engines.’ This military meaning can still be seen in use today with the Corps of Royal Engineers and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The word ‘engine’ itself comes from the Latin word ‘ingenium’ (c. 1250), which means ‘innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention.’ Engineering developed beyond military applications and began to be applied to civilian structures like bridges and buildings, leading to the creation of the term civil engineering, to differentiate it from the original military engineering field.   What Does an Engineer Do? Engineers are involved in the design, evaluation, development, testing, modification, inspection and maintaining of a wide range of products, structures and systems. This involves everything from the recommending of materials and processes, overseeing manufacturing and construction processes, and conducting failure analysis and investigation, to providing consultancy services and teaching engineering to students and trainees.  Types of Engineering There are many different types of engineering, often divided into areas in which the engineer operates. For example, engineers working within the oil and gas industry could be petroleum engineers, while those working in farming-related applications could be called agricultural engineers. While there are some traditional areas of engineering, such as mechanical and civil engineering, other engineering fields require an overlapping of different specialities. So, for example, a civil engineer may also need an understanding of structural engineering or an aerospace engineer may need to understand aspects of electrical or computer engineering too. These types of engineering are commonly known as interdisciplinary engineering and include manufacturing engineering, acoustic engineering, corrosion engineering, aerospace, automotive, computer, textiles, geological, materials and nuclear engineering, among others. These areas of engineering are all among the branches of engineering that are represented by the 36 licensed member institutions of the UK Engineering Council.  Here are some of the traditional and more common interdisciplinary engineering fields: 1. Mechanical Engineering Mechanical tical knowhow to deliver products, services and processes. Engineers keep pushing humankind forward, developing new innovations, protecting lives, preventing diseases and helping to keep the planet itself safe and clean. Certainly, industry has been responsible for problems such as fossil fuel use and the associated climate change, but it is to engineering we must turn to solve the crisis and deliver sustainable alternatives. As real world problem solvers, engineers continue to be important across all parts of society. Why engineering is a good career Aside from the good job prospects and security, as well as the higher average wages, engineering is a good career because it gives you the opportunity to work for the benefit of society. Whether it is through improved transportation systems, delivering better medical devices and technologies, finding new cleaner energy sources, increasing living standards for underdeveloped nations or solving the problem of global hunger, engineering plays a part in changing people’s lives for the better. The career can bring you a great many personal benefits, such as travel, high rates of pay and good job security, but it also gives you the opportunity to use your knowledge, skills and experience to make a real difference to the world.
