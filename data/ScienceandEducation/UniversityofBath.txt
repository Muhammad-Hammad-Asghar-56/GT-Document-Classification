Engineering is the designing, testing and building of machines, structures and processes using maths and science. Studying it can lead to a rewarding career.            Engineering is a discipline dedicated to problem solving. Our built environment and infrastructure, the devices we use to communicate, the processes that manufacture our medicines, have all been designed, assembled or managed by an engineer. You will find engineers working on advanced prosthetics, creating new materials, investigating engine efficiency and alternative fuels, constructing bridges or developing clean water systems. From satellites to cell membranes engineers use maths and science to achieve extraordinary things and find solutions to some of the world's most complex challenges.           What is Engineering? Our student-made film gives you an overview.                       The different engineering disciplines     Our two-minute introductory videos explain what careers and study in civil, mechanical, electronic and chemical engineering involve. Watch the series                       Studying engineering At Bath, our students study BEng and MEng engineering courses across civil, mechanical, electrical and chemical disciplines.            During their degrees our students combine creativity in design with scientific analysis to develop new products, processes and structures. Working individually and in groups they solve problems and develop concepts to improve the world around them.                                              'Engineers need good mathematical ability, but much more than that. They have to be imaginative, responsible, creative, and they must be very good at working with all sorts of other people. Geography, economics, art, history, modern languages, psychology, as well as the traditional maths and physics, can all help you to become an excellent engineer.' — Dr Antony Darby, Reader in Structural Engineering  Engineering graduates are in great demand across a variety of fields from industry to academia. They are trained in a range of hard and soft skills that make them highly employable including:  effective communication and presentation team-working and leadership project and time management research, numeracy and design        Visit our undergraduate virtual experience             What is engineering? from University of Bath on Vimeo.                       ‘What I really love about engineering is that you apply everything you learn. You get to put it towards something and then see something take shape.’                      —                       Nicole Meyer                                                MEng (Hons) Electrical and Electronic Engineering with placement year                                                     Read our student blog            My day in 60 seconds     Our architecture and engineering students talk us through their typical day studying at Bath. The challenge? They only have 60 seconds to do it in.
