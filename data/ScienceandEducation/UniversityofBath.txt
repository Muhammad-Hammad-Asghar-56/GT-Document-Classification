The different engineering disciplines Our two-minute introductory videos explain careers study civil, mechanical, electronic chemical engineering involve. Watch series Studying engineering At Bath, students study BEng MEng engineering courses across civil, mechanical, electrical chemical disciplines. During degrees students combine creativity design scientific analysis develop new products, processes structures. Working individually groups solve problems develop concepts improve world around them. 'Engineers need good mathematical ability, much that. They imaginative, responsible, creative, must good working sorts people. Geography, economics, art, history, modern languages, psychology, well traditional maths physics, help become excellent engineer.' — Dr Antony Darby, Reader Structural Engineering Engineering graduates great demand across variety fields industry academia.
