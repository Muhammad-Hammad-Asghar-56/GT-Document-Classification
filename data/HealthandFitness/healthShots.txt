Some people think it’s a cakewalk — that’s because they think it’s just about eating left, right and centre. Well, if you’re one of them, you are highly mistaken. Even when you have to gain weight, it is important to ensure that your health isn’t compromised.      You must have seen your favourite celebs gaining weight for certain roles, but that doesn’t mean they can hog on anything and everything they like! Instead, they go on a nutritionist-recommended diet and try healthy weight gain foods, so that when time comes to lose those kilos, it isn’t mission impossible for them. Plus, if you don’t follow the right approach, there can be severe repercussions for your organs; even your skin and hair health can go for a toss. That’s why it is important to understand exactly what you must eat to gain weight the natural way. Before we get down to the details, it is essential to understand why it’s hard to gain weight. We have with us Kanchan Patwardhan, clinical dietitian and nutritionist, and founder of Kanchan’s House of Health and Nutrition, who is here to tell us all.         Unhealthy ways of weight gain can make your body go out of proportion.
