It’s time to flip the script and focus on building that body you’ve always dreamed of. Let’s look at the best foods to help gain weight. Let go of ineffective quick fixes. We’re talking about nourishing your body with the good stuff – wholesome carbs, protein-packed meats, healthy fats, and yes, even the occasional indulgent treat. Gaining weight isn’t about going all-out in one meal. It’s about consistency and balance. Start by fueling up with smaller, frequent meals and incorporating these 14 weight-gaining foods into your daily eats. From hearty grains to muscle-building proteins, we’ve got everything you need to kickstart your gains and boost those energy levels. So, are you ready to say goodbye to those skinny jeans and hello to a stronger, fitter you? Let’s do this, FitFam! How Many Calories Do You Need to Gain Weight?           Let’s dive into a key ingredient for gaining weight: calories. Now, calories are like the fuel that powers our bodies, found in everything we eat and drink. To pack on the pounds, we’ve got to take in more calories than we burn. It’s all about creating a calorie surplus, where those extra calories either bulk up as fat or help build muscle. But how many calories do you really need? Well, it varies from person to person based on things like age, gender, how active you are, and your metabolism. A good place to start is by figuring out your basal metabolic rate (BMR)—that’s the number of calories your body needs to function at rest. Then, you can add extra calories based on how much you move and your weight gain goals. Generally, aiming for an extra 250 to 500 calories per day is a sweet spot for gradual weight gain. It’s a healthy pace that won’t stress your body out too much. Remember, not all calories are created equally, though. Sure, it’s tempting to load up on calorie bombs like junk food, but we’ve got to focus on fueling up with good stuff. Think nutrient-packed foods that give us the vitamins, minerals, and macros we need to thrive. So, let’s load up on wholesome eats like whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats, fruits, and veggies. They’re the real MVPs when it comes to supporting our weight gain goals and building a stronger, fitter version of ourselves.Ready to eat some of the best foods for weight gain? 14 Best Foods To Eat To Gain Weight           Buckle up, because here’s your ultimate lineup of healthy weight gain foods: 1. Nuts and Nut Butter These little guys are like nature’s treasure chest, packed with all the good stuff your body needs to bulk up and build muscle. Make sure to skip the processed stuff and go straight for the whole nuts – you’ll get more bang for your buck without any sneaky added sugars or oils. Take almonds, for instance. They’re a solid choice, giving you about 160 calories and 6 grams of protein per ounce. And if you’re into peanut butter (who isn’t?), a couple of tablespoons of the natural kind will set you up with around 190 calories and 8 grams of protein. Incorporating nuts and nut butters into your routine is a breeze. Grab a handful of nuts for a quick snack on the go, or slather some nut butter on toast or apple slices for a tasty treat. Feeling fancy? Toss ’em into salads, yogurt, or smoothies for an extra crunch and calorie boost. Here are a few simple ways to get your nut fix:  Sprinkle chopped nuts on salads or mix ’em into your favorite cooked grains. Stir nut butter into yogurt for a creamy twist, or spread it on whole grain crackers for a satisfying snack. Blend nuts or nut butter into your morning smoothie for an extra punch of flavor and creaminess. And hey, why not use nut butter as a dip for sliced fruits like apples or bananas?   Here are some great peanut butter recipes to get you started. Just remember to keep it real—opt for unsalted and minimally processed options to get the most out of these nutritious gems. 2. Homemade Protein Smoothies These shakes are like liquid gold when it comes to fueling your muscles and satisfying your cravings.  Grab your favorite protein powder – whether it’s classic whey or a plant-based option like pea protein.  Let’s talk liquids. You can go for the classic milk or almond milk or even soy milk will do the trick. Want to keep it light? Water works just fine too! Next, add some healthy fats to the mix. Think nut butter, creamy avocado, or a splash of coconut oil. These bad boys not only amp up the calories but also keep you feeling full. Toss in your favorite fruits like bananas, berries, or mangoes. Feeling adventurous? How about some spinach or kale for an extra nutrient boost? Last but not least, if you have a sweet tooth you can add a sweetener. Drizzle in some honey, real maple syrup, or throw in a few dates for that perfect touch of sweetness.  Try this nighttime protein smoothie before bed. Once you’ve got all your ingredients ready, toss ’em in the blender and let it rip until it’s smooth as silk. Don’t be afraid to get creative and mix things up to suit your taste buds! 3. Red Meats Beef, lamb, and pork are like the superheroes of the protein world. Packed with top-notch protein and essential nutrients like iron, zinc, and B vitamins, these meats are your body’s best friends for energy and muscle function. Adding red meat to your diet is like hitting the jackpot – it gives you a boost in calories and provides all the goodness your muscles need to repair and grow. A small 3-ounce serving of cooked beef delivers around 180 calories and a whopping 22 grams of protein. Try wrapping your veggies in flank steak for a great way to increase your veg and red meat. Now, when you’re picking your red meat, go for the lean cuts like sirloin or tenderloin, and trim off any extra fat before cooking to keep it lean and mean. Grill it, roast it, or stir-fry it – the options are endless for creating delicious and nutritious meals. Pair your red meat with some complex carbs like sweet potatoes or brown rice, and don’t forget to load up on colorful veggies for that extra nutrient boost and fiber. 4. Fish When it comes to fish like salmon, mackerel, trout, and sardines, they’re not just tasty, they’re loaded with omega-3 fatty acids, top-quality protein, and all the good stuff our bodies need. And those omega-3s are fantastic. They’re anti-inflammatory, which means they help our muscles recover faster after hitting the gym and lower our risk of getting sick. Adding oily fish into our meals is a breeze – grill ’em, bake ’em, steam ’em, or just crack open a can. I like to pair them with whole grains and veggies for a meal that’s as delicious as it is nutritious. Now, let’s get to the good stuff – here are a few mouthwatering ways we can enjoy oily fish:  Salmon avocado toast: I love slathering some mashed avocado on whole grain toast, then topping it with canned salmon, sliced radishes, and a sprinkle of everything bagel seasoning. It’s the perfect way to start my day.
