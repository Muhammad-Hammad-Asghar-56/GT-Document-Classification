However, there are a significant number of people who struggle with their bony fame, failing to add the needed mass.Â Being underweight or skinny may have an underlying issue. Eating too few calories for a prolonged period makes you underweight that leads to different medical illnesses. Conversely, eating too many calories causes a person to become overweight, which is also a not good sign.Â The weight gain equation is pretty much simple as you consume more calories than you burn.

However, eating five to six times a day, eating more protein and fat, adding high-calorie snacks are among the ways to gain weight naturally.Â People consume various supplements and unhealthy food to gain weight quickly without proper research. These may land them into some medical problems, thus think twice before eating anything. Instead, eat healthy foods that build muscle and increase your strength. If you are trying to gain some weight, here are a few options for healthy foods that you should eat.Gaining weight can be relatively straightforward for non-vegetarians, given their wide array of food choices.
