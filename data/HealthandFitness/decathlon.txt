You can gain weight fast if you are persistent in choosing the best plan.READ MOREDecathlon   IntroductionMuscle building and weight gain are not straightforward. Just like weight loss diet programmes, there are also weight gain diet plans. A weight gain diet should include enough calories and high-quality protein. Choosing the right weight-gain diet is critical. A good weight-growth diet offers critical nutrients and helps you increase muscle mass.Any diet plan for weight gain has its primary goal to feed you with more calories than you expend in a day. A weight gain diet chart includes an increase in all macronutrients: carbs, proteins, healthy fats, and calories. So pick your diet carefully, bearing in mind its nutritious worth.This article discusses all parts of a proper eating plan for weight growth.‍What Exactly Is a Healthy Weight Range?BMI is a basic, affordable, and straightforward method of calculating body fat. BMI is computed by dividing an individual's weight in pounds by his or her height in inches squared and multiplying by a conversion factor of 703 based on height and weight. The following is how the result is interpreted:Below 18.5 – UnderweightBetween 18.5 and 24.9 – Healthy weightBetween 25.0 and 29.9 – OverweightAbove 30.0 – Obese10 Healthy Foods to Gain Weight FastGaining weight or adding muscle can be as difficult for some people as losing weight is for others. However, simply adding certain foods to your diet can help you gain weight healthily and effectively. Eating breakfast is important, but what you eat for your meals matters too. Everyone's individual caloric needs are different, so talk to a dietitian to determine what's right for your body, activity level, and goals. Here are ten healthy food options for weight gain. Have a look! Here is the list of 10 best foods for healthy weight gain or muscle gain.1. MilkUnlike popular opinion, milk is not the worst. In fact, studies have shown that people tend to gain muscle mass when they drink milk in combination with weight training. It’s beneficial for muscle growth as it contains the perfect balance of nutrition to support muscle growth and replenish depleted glycogen stores after intense exercise.‍2. RiceIf you’re looking to gain weight, rice is probably your best friend. Convenient and a low-cost carb, it can obtain a high amount of carbs and calories from a single serving. Have it with your favourite dal or mix it with mangoes for a sticky rice dish. You can also stir it up with finely chopped veggies like carrots, onions and cabbage to get your take on the dish of fried rice. 3. Peanut ButterAll nuts and nut butter are the perfect choices to gain weight. Since nuts are very calorie-dense, just two handfuls per day with a meal or as a snack can quickly add hundreds of calories. You can add nut butter to a variety of snacks or dishes, such as smoothies, yoghurts, and crackers, to turn them into a high-calorie snack in no time.4. Red MeatMeats that are red when raw are defined as red meats. This includes lamb, beef, pork and some others. Pick your choice according to what’s available easily and go from there. Steak contains both leucine and creatine, nutrients that play a significant role in boosting muscle mass. Steak and other red meats contain both protein and fat, which promote weight gain.5. Dried FruitsDried fruits are rich in nutrients and calories. You can get many different types of dried fruit, and they all have naturally high sugar content. This makes them great for gaining weight, especially since they’re convenient to eat and taste great. From dates and raisins to almonds and walnuts, the choices in the market are endless.6. AvocadosYes, you heard it right! Avocados are not just about Instagram shots but are a great choice for you to gain weight.  Full of healthy fats and nutrients, avocados are also high in vitamins, minerals, and various beneficial plant compounds. One of the most popular and easiest ways of enjoying avocado is on avocado toast. Just mash up some avocado and spread it on your toast. Squeeze a bit of lemon and there you have it!7. Dark ChocolateKeeping even the dementors away, dark chocolate helps reduce the risk of heart disease, some cancers, inflammation, stress, and type 2 diabetes while keeping your spirits up. Garnish your morning cereal with it, put a few curls on top of a fruit plate, or make some steaming-hot drinking (or sipping) chocolate as the Parisians do.8. Full Fat YogurtFull-fat Greek yoghurt is another healthy and convenient snack. It has a great nutritional profile, including a well-balanced mix of protein, carbs, and fat. It’s great on its own or as an ingredient that works in many dishes. Want to make it a little more healthy? Add in some flax seeds and your favourite sweet fruits. Seasonal ones are the best!9. PastaWith so many ways of cooking and serving it, here’s your chance to get creative. Pasta can provide a calorically dense and carbohydrate-rich path to healthy weight gain. Avoid bleached pasta, and opt for those made with whole grains. From spaghetti to penne, you can go in any direction here. But make sure to add a few green veggies like broccoli or spinach on a side for a healthier diet.10. Starch Rich FoodsStarches help some of the foods already listed to boost muscle growth and weight gain. They add bulk to meals and boost the number of calories consumed. Not only do potatoes and other starches add carbs and calories to help you gain weight but they also increase your muscle glycogen stores. Glycogen is the predominant fuel source for most sports and activities.‍6 Tips for a Healthy Weight Gain:1. Consume high-calorie foods -‍Eat high-calorie, high-nutrient foods like bananas, avocados, and full-fat milk to gain weight in a healthy way. A calorie-dense diet is required to gain the appropriate amount of weight for your body type.2. Consume foods with carbohydrates - Including nutritious carbohydrates such as bananas, potatoes, sweet potatoes, red or brown rice, whole grains, and fruits in your diet can help you gain weight safely and healthily. To acquire nutrients that the body requires to operate effectively, try to incorporate excellent quality carbohydrates in some form in all of your meals.3. Foods high in protein - Our muscles are made up of proteins. To gain weight and build lean muscle mass, consume at least 1.5-2 grammes of protein per kilogramme of body weight. Lean proteins may be found in chicken breast, turkey, nuts, lentils, beans, fish, eggs, and milk.4. Stress reduction - ‍Stress causes some people to lose their appetite while others gain it. Stress is damaging to your mental and physical health. Reduce stress through meditation, breathing, listening to music, relaxing, taking hot shower baths, and being active.5. Strength training - The goal should be to increase lean muscle mass rather than fat mass. As a result, working out and doing weight training at least 2-4 times a week is critical. Exercises like pushups, lunges, and squats can be included in your routine.6. Get enough sleep - A good night's sleep may be extremely beneficial to your health. A decent night's sleep of about 8 hours assists to maintain muscle mass and keep your body in shape.‍Diet Plan For Weight Gain - 7 Day ChartHave already made notes to kickstart the new week with a healthy diet plan?
