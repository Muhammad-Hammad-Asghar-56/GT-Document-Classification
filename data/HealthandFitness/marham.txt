Eat 6 Meals Instead of 3 This tip is for those people who do not like to eat large meals at one time or get full before everyone else. You can try to divide your three large meals into six smaller ones, and this way can get the required amount of calories without putting pressure on yourself. 2. Consume Nutrient-rich Foods Add more fiber to your diet by taking more complex carbs instead of simple carbs, adding protein to each meal, eating healthy fats, and loading up on fruits and vegetables. All of these nutrient-dense foods will make sure that your body gains healthy fats and remains full for longer. 3. Choose Healthy Snacks It is important that you include organic snacks in your diet that have an excellent nutritional value along with calories. Some healthy weight gain snacks can be:  Dates Walnuts, almonds, and other nuts Seeds Yogurt Dry fruits  4. Try Strength Training Exercise like strength training can help you build muscle mass and increase your hunger levels. It will make you feel happier and healthier as well because exercise releases happy hormones. 5. Don’t Indulge in Junk Food. Binging on junk foods like chips, cookies, or sweets might help you gain weight, but it won’t be beneficial for your health in the long run.
