You’re not entirely wrong. Eating too much of any type of food — whether carbohydrates, fat or protein — can make you gain weight. But while your body uses mostly carbs and protein for energy, foods that are high in saturated fat, like that fried chicken, make a beeline for your adipose (fat) tissue.
