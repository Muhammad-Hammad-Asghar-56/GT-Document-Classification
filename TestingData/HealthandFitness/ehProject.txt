Weight gain is not all about calories – the quality of the calories matters. Discover 10 of the best whole foods to include in your diet to help add weight to your body.  Top 10 Weight Gain Foods 2024  Rice Eggs Dairy Dried Fruit Red Meat Fatty Fish Potatoes/Starches Whole Grain Bread Avocados Nuts and Nut Butter   Top 10 Healthy Foods To Gain Weight Fast Rice  Rice is relatively inexpensive and easy to make, plus it’s packed with calories, making it an ideal side dish for meals if you want to put on weight. One cup of rice has over 200 calories and roughly 45 grams of carbohydrates. Rice, especially wild or brown rice, is a whole grain, which offers B vitamins among other nutrients, so you can feel good about making rice a regular part of your diet, knowing you’re not compromising your health. Additionally, rice lends itself to additional sources of calories when it comes to flavoring or seasoning the rice – try adding a little cheese, butter, or chopped meat, scrambled eggs, and veggies to make a stir fry. Eggs Eggs are a staple for any muscle-building diet. They are an excellent source of fat, protein, and vitamins. There are 6 grams of protein in one egg and almost 75 calories, but don’t forget to eat the whole egg – white and yolk! Most of the nutrients are found in the yolk. When choosing eggs, whenever possible, opt for pasture-raised or organic, as this ensures that the chickens have the best quality of life and are fed their most natural diet, while not having any hormones or steroids administered to them. Eggs can be an irritant for some people, especially those with egg allergies. But as long as you don’t react to them, they are great to include in your daily diet for healthy weight gain, especially because they are versatile – omelets, in salads, on sandwiches, eaten hard-boiled as a snack, and so forth. Dairy Adding dairy to your diet can be extremely helpful for weight gain. Photo: Tatjana Baibakova/Shutterstock Dairy is a controversial food, especially in the U.S. where some farming methods create questionable consequences for the quality of the products. However, if you have access to organic and unprocessed dairy products (and you’re not lactose intolerant), adding dairy to your diet can be extremely helpful for weight gain. This is due mostly to the high fat content in addition to the quality of protein and carbs. In fact, dairy is one of the few foods that contain all three macronutrients – fat, protein, and carbs. Milk contains both casein and whey protein, which can greatly impact muscle building, especially when combined with weight lifting. Milk and other forms of dairy can be added to meals or eaten alone as a snack. Dried Fruits The process of drying fruit concentrates its sugars, which then enhances its calories. This makes them a great snack or dessert to add to your diet if you’re looking to gain weight. Dates in particular are known for their high sugar content – two dates add up to 130 calories. Additionally, though there is more sugar in dried fruits, they retain all their nutrients, including antioxidants and fiber. Dried fruits are easy to eat on their own, in oatmeal, cereal, rice dishes, or added to spreads like peanut butter or cream cheese. Ideally, dried fruits should be paired with nuts or yogurt (something with fat and protein) to create a more balanced and blood sugar-stabilizing snack. Red Meat It can be challenging for some vegans to gain weight healthily because animal protein, particularly red meat, can help increase weight. Red meat contains leucine, an amino acid the body needs to help build muscle protein, as well as creatine, which is used as a supplement to enhance muscles. A 6-ounce steak has about 450 calories and almost 50 grams of protein. When choosing red meat for weight gain, specifically, it’s best to opt for fattier cuts, rather than lean ones. Additionally, it’s important not to overlook quality when it comes to red meat – when possible, opt for grass-fed, organic beef as opposed to conventional meat which may contain unnecessary and harmful hormones and antibiotics, and in which the cows may have been fed a less-than-ideal diet. Fatty Fish Oily fish contains a powerful combo of protein and healthy fats, which together, add up to healthy calories for weight gain. Salmon, sardines, and mackerel are a few examples of oily, fatty fish with omega-3 fatty acids. Oily fish are consumed regularly by some of the healthiest populations on the planet, which is why oily fish are often associated with longevity. With canning practices, eating lots of oily fish does not require daily trips to the fish market. Though fresh is always best, canned salmon, tuna, and sardines are readily available in most supermarkets and provide adequate health benefits. It’s easy to prepare fish by fileting, frying, baking, or steaming, and any cooking method can be topped with a good dose of olive oil for added omega-3 healthy fats. As with red meat, it’s important to check for quality when purchasing fish – try to buy wild-caught fish, as opposed to “farmed,” because wild-caught fish will not contain any coloring or antibiotics, whereas many farmed fish do. Potatoes/Starch There’s a reason why some people avoid “carbs” when losing weight – they are a hefty source of calories. This comes in handy when trying to add weight. Potatoes and other starches (such as rice, quinoa, buckwheat, corn, squash, oats, and beans) are a valuable source of carbohydrates and, in addition to helping with weight gain, provide the body’s preferred fuel source for energy – glucose. If you choose whole grains and starches, you’ll also be adding essential nutrients, fiber, and prebiotics to your diet (cooked then cooled rice and potatoes turn into resistant starches which act as prebiotics – they feed the good bacteria in the gut). Potatoes and grains also lend themselves to additional toppings and flavorings (such as cheese, seeds, and butter) which add to the calorie content. Whole Grain Bread Whole grain bread (unrefined bread) contains complex, or slow-digesting carbohydrates and generally contains higher amounts of protein compared with white bread. The same is true for whole grains in other forms where you can see the whole grain – oats, quinoa, whole grain cereal, etc. What’s more, whole grains and whole grain bread lend themselves to toppings that can increase their caloric load – nut butter, cheese, and avocado can be spread on toast, and whole grains can be added to smoothies, cereals, and yogurts. Many protein bars are made with whole grains, however, as with other foods, be sure to look out for quality. Read the label for excessive, unnecessary ingredients, such as sugar and preservatives. A granola bar that is mostly sugar will have more of a negative impact on your health than unsweetened granola.  Avocados Avocados are “nature’s butter,” boasting inherent
